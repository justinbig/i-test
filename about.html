              The Burundian coffee sector has gone through major phases and changes, all of which have greatly influenced the coffee production.

              The first stage for coffee was under the supervision of the Belgians until Burundi's independence in 1962. During this period, the Belgians had control over the coffee's production and sales. Coffee was established as a cash crop.

	   	  	raditional Burundian processing methods are used by the cooperatives/washing stations from which we are buying. This method is where the coffee is depulped and “dry fermented” up to 12 hours before being fully washed with clean mountain water from 12 to 24 hours. This initial water introduction stops the fermentation process if any sugars remain on the parchment after the dry fermentation. Coffee is then floated down water channels to separate beans by density, then finally the beans are soaked again for an additional 12 to 18 hours before being dried in parchment on raised beds.
